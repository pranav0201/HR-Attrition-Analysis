HR Attrition Analysis — Business Insights

1. Overall Attrition Landscape

The organization experiences a material level of employee attrition, indicating that retention is a significant business concern. Attrition is not evenly distributed, suggesting that exits are driven by identifiable structural and behavioral factors rather than random turnover.

2. Department and Role-Level Attrition

Attrition varies considerably across departments and job roles. Certain roles and departments consistently exhibit higher exit rates, indicating that attrition challenges are role-specific rather than company-wide.

Implication:
HR retention strategies should be targeted at specific roles and teams rather than applied uniformly across the organization.

3. Early Career Attrition

Employees in their first two years of employment show the highest attrition rates. Younger employees and early-tenure staff are significantly more likely to leave than experienced employees.

Implication:
Improving onboarding, mentorship, and early-career engagement can significantly reduce attrition.

4. Workload and Burnout Factors

Employees working overtime demonstrate substantially higher attrition. Poor work-life balance further amplifies this risk, especially when combined with long commute distances.

Implication:
Burnout is a major attrition driver. Addressing sustained overtime and workload distribution can have a strong retention impact.

5. Career Progression and Promotion Stagnation

Employees who have not received a promotion for three or more years exhibit noticeably higher attrition rates. Promotion stagnation proves to be a stronger driver of attrition than salary alone.

Implication:
Career visibility and progression planning are critical retention levers.

6. Compensation Insights

Employees earning below the average compensation for their job role are more likely to leave. However, compensation alone does not fully explain attrition without considering satisfaction and growth factors.

Implication:
Targeted pay adjustments are more effective than blanket salary increases.

7. Satisfaction and Workplace Culture

Low job satisfaction, poor environment satisfaction, and weak work-life balance scores strongly correlate with employee exits. These satisfaction indicators outperform compensation in explaining attrition.

Implication:
Manager effectiveness, team culture, and employee engagement are critical to retention.

8. Attrition Risk Scoring

A rule-based attrition risk scoring model was developed using explainable factors such as:
  -Overtime
  -Job satisfaction
  -Work-life balance
  -Promotion stagnation
  -Tenure
  -Commute distance
  -Compensation relative to role average

Employees classified as high risk showed significantly higher historical attrition, validating the model’s effectiveness.

Implication:
HR can proactively identify at-risk employees and intervene before resignations occur.

9. Recommended HR Actions
  -Reduce sustained overtime in high-risk roles
  -Strengthen early-career onboarding and mentorship programs
  -Introduce promotion or role-rotation discussions after 2–3 years
  -Improve manager training focused on engagement and work-life balance
  -Use risk scoring to prioritize retention conversations

Final Takeaway

This analysis demonstrates how SQL-driven analytics can move HR teams from descriptive reporting to proactive, data-driven retention strategies, enabling better workforce planning and reduced attrition costs.
